# Etch-a-sketch

A fresh take on Etch a sketch.

Users can create a grid ranging from 10x10 to 64x64.

The grid is capped at 64x64 to reduce impact on computer performace.

Users are able to reset their sketch without refreshing the page and unlike 
traditional games users are able to change their colour mid sketch

The grid has a green shadow when in use and a red shadow when a grid needs to be generated.
